# LeanPackageValidator GitHub Action

The LeanPackageValidator GitHub Action is utilising the [LeanPackage Validator](https://github.com/raphaelstolt/lean-package-validator), which can validate a 
project/micro-package for its `leanness`. A project/micro-package is considered `lean` when its common 
repository artifacts won't be included in the release assets.
